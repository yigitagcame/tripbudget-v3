    question: 'How does Trip Budget solve fragmented travel planning?',
    answer: 'Instead of jumping between blogs, booking sites, Google Maps, and spreadsheets, Trip Budget brings everything into one AI-powered platform. You can plan your entire trip through natural conversation, get personalized recommendations, and track your budget automatically - all in one place.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the AI conversation work?',
    answer: 'Simply tell our AI about your travel preferences, budget, and interests in natural language. For example, "I want to plan a 5-day trip to Paris with a â‚¬2000 budget. I love art and food." The AI will understand your needs and suggest flights, hotels, and activities that match your criteria.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the automatic budget tracking work?',
    answer: 'Our AI automatically calculates costs for flights, hotels, and activities as you plan. You can see real-time budget updates, get alerts when you approach your limit, and view detailed cost breakdowns. No more manual spreadsheet calculations!'
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the card system and how does it help?',
    answer: 'The card system organizes all your selected travel options into interactive cards. You can view booking links, edit selections, compare options, and keep everything organized visually. It\'s like having a digital travel board that updates in real-time.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to create an account to use Trip Budget?',
    answer: 'Yes, we use secure authentication via Supabase to protect your travel data and preferences. This allows us to save your trip plans, remember your preferences, and provide personalized recommendations across sessions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How accurate are the flight and hotel recommendations?',
    answer: 'Our AI uses function calling with real-time data sources to provide accurate recommendations. While we strive for accuracy, actual prices may vary due to availability and seasonal changes. We always show you the most current information available.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I collaborate with friends and family on trip planning?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our real-time chat features allow you to share your trip plans and collaborate with others. Everyone can contribute to the planning process, making it perfect for group trips and family vacations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I\'m not satisfied with the service?',
    answer: 'We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you\'re not completely satisfied with Trip Budget, contact our support team within 30 days of your purchase and we\'ll provide a full refund.'
