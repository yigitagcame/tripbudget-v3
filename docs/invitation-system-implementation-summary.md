# Invitation System Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

The invitation link system has been fully implemented and is now functional. Here's what was built:

### 1. Core Components

#### Frontend Routes
- **`/invite/[code]`** - Invitation link page that stores referral code and redirects to login
- **Updated `/auth/callback`** - Handles referral code application after successful signup

#### Backend API
- **`/api/referrals/use`** - API endpoint for using referral codes and granting bonus messages

#### UI Components
- **Updated `GetMoreMessagesModal`** - Now creates real referral codes in database
- **`Toast` component** - Success/error notifications
- **`ToastContext`** - Global toast management

### 2. Database Integration

The system uses the existing message counter tables:
- `user_message_counters` - Tracks user message counts
- `user_referrals` - Tracks referral codes and usage

### 3. User Flow

1. **User A** opens "Get More Messages" modal
2. **System** generates unique referral code and stores in database
3. **User A** shares invitation link (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/invite/ABC123`)
4. **User B** visits invitation link
5. **System** stores referral code in localStorage and redirects to login
6. **User B** completes OAuth signup
7. **System** applies referral bonus to both users during auth callback
8. **Both users** receive bonus messages and see success notification

### 4. Environment Variables

Required environment variables (already configured):
```env
MESSAGE_COUNTER_INITIAL_COUNT=50
MESSAGE_COUNTER_REFERRAL_BONUS=25
NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGE_COUNTER_REFERRAL_BONUS=25
```

### 5. Security Features

- âœ… Referral codes are single-use only
- âœ… Only authenticated users can use referral codes
- âœ… Users can only access their own referrals
- âœ… Invalid/used codes are properly rejected
- âœ… Error handling prevents signup flow disruption

### 6. Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
npm run test:invitation
```
